# CarpedditLite
A lite edition (fork/replica) of client for [r]eddit. My uncomplete attempt to fix "baconit" via RnD Carpeddit auth system.

## How to build?
[See building instructions here](https://github.com/itsWindows11/Carpeddit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-app).

## Status
- Min. os. win. build targeted to 15063.
- All solution is damaged.. The are hard bugs after 16299-> 15063
  (too many components are standard2.0-based, sadly!)

## TODO
Try to fix my strange "w10m" code set...
