# CarpedditLite
A lite edition (fork/replica) of client for [r]eddit. My uncomplete attempt to fix my [baconit](https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/baconit) fork via RnD Carpeddit auth system.

## How to build?
[See building instructions here](https://github.com/itsWindows11/Carpeddit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-app).

## Status
- Min. os. win. build targeted to 16299.
- I noticed that Carpedit's auth system is very good... but its code realization is so difficult to me :/
- 16299-> 15063 failed (too many components are standard2.0-based, sadly!)

## TODO
Try to do "15063 downshifting" (i.e. downgrading sdk to 15063...)

## As is. No support. DIY.
